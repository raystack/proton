  Raccoon uses the identifier to send response of the request. The client can handle the
  response accordingly. For example, the client can retry the request in case the response is
  giving `INTERNAL_ERROR` code with "publisher failed" reason.

  This identifier is necessary because on event-based protocols like WebSocket the response is
  returned asynchronously. If there is no identifier, no way the client can tell which response
  belongs to which request.

  Apart from sending response, `req_guid` is used to log some informations on 'debug' level. You can search the 
  debug logs with `ReqGUID` keyword.
